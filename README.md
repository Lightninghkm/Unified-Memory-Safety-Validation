# Unified Memory Safety Validation

This framework is the push-button solution of the combined memory safety validations of the [DataGuard](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2022-60-paper.pdf) and the [Uriah](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3658644.3690310) frameworks.

## Installation
The framework is tested on [Ubuntu 20.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/focal/), it has not been tested on other platforms up to now, so Ubuntu 20.04 is preferred.

### LLVM 10.0.0

This project implements the memory safety validation as an out-of-tree LLVM pass.

To compile an out-of-tree LLVM pass, the [prebuilt LLVM binaries](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) are needed.

Or you can download them using apt:
```bash
sudo apt-get install llvm-10 clang-10
```

Make sure you specify the ```$PATH```s correctly.

### Build SVF

The SVF code is available in ```./program-dependence-graph/SVF```

To build SVF for alias analysis, run:

```bash
sudo apt install cmake gcc g++ libtinfo5 libz-dev libzstd-dev zip wget libncurses5-dev

cd ./program-dependence-graph/SVF 
source ./build.sh
```

### Build PDG

The PDG code is available in ```/program-dependence-graph```

```
cd ./program-dependence-graph
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ..
```

### Build Validation

To build the memory safety validation pass, simply run:

```
cd ..
cmake .
make
```

Now you should be able to see the ```libUnifiedMemSafe.so``` in the root directory of this pass.

## Usage
This framework performs memory safety validation on the LLVM bitcode of the program that you would like to analyze.

In case you need help with building whole-program (or whole-library) LLVM bitcode files from an unmodified C or C++ source package that you would like to analyze, please see [wllvm](https://github.com/travitch/whole-program-llvm).

It's time to run the analysis and save the result in ```output.txt```:
```bash
opt-10 -load libUnifiedMemSafe.so -unified -disable-output < bitcode.bc > output.txt 2>&1
```

If you would like to print the results in cmd: 
```bash
opt-10 -load libUnifiedMemSafe.so -unified -disable-output < bitcode.bc
```

## Detailed Analysis Results
There are commented print statements in the source code of this framework in case you want to know more in addition to the default results, e.g., detailed information of unsafe objects. Uncomment those and you will get what you want :->.

## Tips
SVF modifies the original program's bitcode to facilitate its alias analysis by inserting instructions.

As a result, you may notice that the printed instructions have variable names with offsets compared to the original bitcode. For example, ```%100``` in the original bitcode might appear as ```%108``` in the analysis output. This behavior is unavoidable.

If you want to use the bitcode after the analysis for additional purposes, e.g., instrument the program with runtime checks, use the following command to obtain the resultant bitcode:

```bash
opt-10 -o output.bc -load libUnifiedMemSafe.so -unified < bitcode.bc
```
